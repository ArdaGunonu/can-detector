I extracted images from videos with "video_to_image.py" file
I have a dataset of 508 images (train set: 457  validation set: 51) in dataset file.
I use CVAT data annotation tool on web for creating labels.

YOLO model trained with this dataset (100 epoch).

Predicted videos are created to predictions file with threshold value is end of its name.

Note: Model is trained for close-up videos on a table
